<h1>The DeezNetz Network Monitor</h1>
<strong>Prologue: Why Another Network Monitor?</strong>
</p>
<p>
After everyone threw out their PERL scripted homegrown solutions from the 
90's and put their faith and trust in fancy third party commercial 
products that subsequently got compromised and became, 'Poison Well', 
security attacks invited in by System Administrators with little 
programming knowledge who just couldn't see inside the compiled updates 
without the source to know if they were being hacked or not I started 
thinking about, 'the pingofdeath.pl', I wrote and used to monitor The 
Money Store Nationwide network back in the day and that maybe someone 
should take a big step back and write a similar simple solution using 
this decades more popular and secure tools with a fancier interface. A 
tool for SysAdmin by SysAdmin. Some easily configured and expanded 
scripts able to be edited separately for each client and yet more 
scalable to handle the bigger clouds of today. DeezNetz is the result. 
Anyone with basic Python/JavaScript/XML/XSLT/Linux skills can modify and
 expand the client side mechanism for generic and custom services 
developed in house to see exactly what it's doing and how, able to run 
CRC checks to know if it's been modified etc. I made getting started as 
simple as I could too. You write a deezhosts file of hostnames to 
monitor, run deezcrawl.py on each that writes an XML file of every port 
in etc/services listening, drills into every web service and adds the 
URL to check for a, "200", response, mkdir /usr/share/deez and copy 
checkDeez.py and it's packed.xsl for formatting messages. Build a web 
server to monitor from and fire off sweepDeez.py to collect stats and 
write the web pages to /var/www/html/deez. Adding Logstash, Kibana or 
Grafana for extra fancy graphing would be optiona and good exercise, 
customization of the display to suit the scale and type of your networks
 should be a snap. If your net fits in one page don't use two and cut 
down on your SysAdmin's clicking. The perfect network monitor in my 
belief should have an either red or green view, is it all good or bad, 
then drill down to find what's bad but Deez Netz doesn't force that on 
anyone. SMS or emailing of alerts or status is optional should be just 
icing on the cake. The emphasis here is on the framework to give every a
 place to start and learn about programming network protocols in Python,
 more powerful Javascript and hopefully illustrate and bring back the 
popularity of XSLT and illustrate why you should be using the power of 
XML over lame JSON or weak YAML.
</p>

<strong>Systemd Units</strong>
</p>
<p>
The machine behind the curtain making DeezNetz work is the new next 
generation inetd/xinetd replacement systemd. I was studying how it 
worked for service/socket/timer management in Redhat and realized I 
could use anything to write an httpd service as long as I obeyed a few 
rules and output the expected header lines. The script on every client 
monitored is, checkDeez.py and it fakes it as an HTTP web service. You 
can test and sample the state of anyone with any browser. It only knows 
three commands however: a simple are you ok message of RED, YELLOW or 
GREEN is returned from http://hostname:8142/OK, only what's wrong is 
returned by http://hostname:8142/ERR and the state of everything it's 
monitoring is returned by http://hostname:8142/FULL. The script that 
sweeps the network and builds the web interface files, 
index.html/red.html/yellow.html/green.html, is sweepDeez.py. The 
Javascript in them calls checkDeez.py service and displays the 
summaries. The index.html in action looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="" src="ryg.png"/>
<p>
Note the green background and numbers on the buttons, it would change to 
yellow if there were one or more condition yellow hosts and red if there
 was one or more hosts completely out of touch. Green is all services 
and hosts accounted for, yellow is host responding to sweepDeez.py and 
reporting a monitored URL not responding with a, "200", response code or
 a monitored port not responding at all. DeezNetz sees into web 
applications and checks all links are valid. Drilling down into the 
buttons gives a summary page, in this case green:
</p>
<img alt="" src="greenlist.png"/>
</div>
<p>
Clicking on my moniker takes you back to the index, clicking on the top summary 
buttons takes you to those color condition list pages. The white button 
for each host in this condition will bring up a summary window sslike 
so, for green it is everything that is being monitored.
</p>
<img alt="" src="greenfull1.png"/>
<p>
Scroll a bit and you'll see it monitors not only web application URL's 
but all mounted disk usage levels and available memory too.
</p>
<img alt="" src="greenfull2.png"/>
<p>
Here I'll turn off tomcat on butthead and run sweepDeez.py on our central 
monitor web server. He is the server and client both, note sweepDeez.py 
connects on port 8142 and that runs the client service checkDeez.py, I 
do not touch it.
</p>
<img alt="" src="rygy.png"/>
<p>Clicking the yellow button brings up the list of hosts in condition yellow.
</p>
<img alt="" src="yellowlist.png"/>
<p>
Clicking on a white hostname button in condition yellow issues an ERR command 
and returns just the issues that's put it in this list along with the 
disk levels and memory usage. In this case it's showing us I turned off 
Apache Tomcat which is mis-labeled in /etc/services as, "webcache". If I
 was in production I'd correct that so it would show the proper name of 
what was broken.
</p>

<p>
That's pretty much it for operation, the RED page just tries to do an OK 
command and you'll run out of sockets after too many retries, so reboot 
it or fix the network instead, something seriously wrong there. There 
are two more scripts, one that installs the service, socket and a line 
in /etc/services for you, deezyall.py and another that installs the 
timer unit to run sweepDeez.py periodically and update the web pages on 
the central monitor server. only deezyall.py should be run on the 
clients. The service unit file is /lib/systemd/system/deeznetz@.service.

SECURITY ALERT: At the bottom of checkDeez.py there is a line you must change to your domain to protect against cross domain scripting attacks see links below on CORS and the header, change the, '*', to your proper domain.

As always RFC, looking for any volunteers with a few thousand hosts to test on. Hope you find this useful in any capacity.

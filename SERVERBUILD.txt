BUILDING A DEEZNETZ MONITOR SERVER
Unpack the scripts somewhere, substitute your hostname for, `hostname`.
$ unzip deeznetz.zip 

Create the client's work directory.
$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/deez
Create a location on the 
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/deez

Copy the script that is run by the timer and sweeps the network there.
$ sudo cp sweepDeez.py /usr/share/deez/
Copy the script that is run by sweepDeez connecting to a port if you want to monitor your server too.
$ sudo cp checkDeez.py /usr/share/deez/
Copy the script that builds a configuration of ports/urls for checkDeez to check. You can edit your `hostname`.xml to suit, 'xmllint --format `hostname.xml`', will show you what is going to be monitored and what deezcrawl.py found.
$ sudo cp deezcrawl.py /usr/share/deez/

Copy the XSLT stylesheets used by sweepDeez and checkDeez to /usr/share/deez:
colors.xsl - makes green.html/yellow.html/red.html 
host.xsl - extracts the hostname returned by an OK command
status.xsl - extracts the RED/YELLOW/GREEN returned by OK command
packed.xsl - formats the results of an ERR or FULL command
ryg.xsl - makes the index.html page

Create a deezhosts file of hostnames to monitor, one hostname per line.
$ sudo vi /usr/share/deez/deezhosts

Watch /var/www/html/deez and index.html/red.html/yellow.html/green.html should appear after the sweepDeez.py sweeps. 
sudo chown -R apache:apache /usr/share/deez /var/www/html
Add yourself to the group:
sudo usermod -a -G apache <your login name>
Set permissions to the directories and scripts/stylesheets:
sudo chmod -R 0770 /usr/share/deez /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 0660 /usr/share/deez/*.xsl 
sudo chmod -R 0550 /usr/share/deez/*.py

Create and install the systemd service/socket units to run checkDeez.ph when connected. 
$ sudo ./deezyall.py

Create and install the systemd timer unit to run sweepDeez.py every 15 minutes or so to taste.
$ sudo ./deeztimer.py

Enable the timer and service and check their status
systemctl enable sweepDeez.service
systemctl start sweepDeez.service
systemctl status sweepDeez.service
systemctl enable sweepDeez.timer
systemctl start sweepDeez.timer
systemctl status sweepDeez.timer

Check the service locally with wget or your browser at the following url's.
http://hostname:8142/OK   - should get status of RED, YELLOW or GREEN
http://hostname:8142/ERR  - should return tables of services down
http://hostname:8142/FULL - should return everything it knows

Server not hitting it?
$ sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service deeznetz
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
Should be working now! 

There is a header line at the bottom, line 183 in checkDeez.py:
sys.stdout.write("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n");
the, '*', allows any host from across domains to connect, you should edit this to your domain, google, 'CORS', for information on cross-site scripting errors, especially if you are on a public network. Screen the deeznetz port 8142 carefully on your firewalls.
